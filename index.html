        <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p> During my virtual classes in front-end development, I had the opportunity to acquire a comprehensive set of skills and
            deepen my understanding of the field. Over the course of the program, I delved into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, gaining
            proficiency in crafting responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. The virtual class provided a platform for
            hands-on learning, where I successfully completed various projects that challenged me to implement complex layouts,
            optimize website performance, and integrate interactive features. Collaborating with classmates and instructors in the
            virtual environment allowed me to sharpen my communication and teamwork skills, as we leveraged online forums and video
            conferences to exchange ideas and provide valuable feedback. I encountered and overcame numerous obstacles throughout
            the program, developing strong problem-solving abilities and an adaptive mindset. By continuously seeking additional
            resources beyond the virtual classes, such as online tutorials and coding challenges, I demonstrated my commitment to
            lifelong learning and staying updated in this rapidly evolving field. Overall, the virtual class experience in front-end
            development has equipped me with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to pursue real-world projects and thrive in the
            industry.</p>
